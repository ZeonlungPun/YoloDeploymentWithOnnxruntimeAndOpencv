This repository contains the C++ deployment implentation of some popular object detection and other computer vision tasks.

Now we offer the implentation of Opencv 4.8, onnxruntime and libtorch framework inference codes mainly on linux platform with cmakelist files.

The models now include Yolov5 , Yolov7, Yolov8 ,RTDETR for object detection.

Yolov8obb for rotated object detection.

YoloP for Autopilotã€‚

Yolov8pose for key points detection.
